This project first proposed the detection theory based on anomalous behavior analysis, designs the anomalous behavior analysis methods based on DBN and QPSO-OCSVM, and build a detection model on this basis.       
Then, a hardware trojan detection platform designed and implemented, where three trigger-type hardware Trojans for the AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption in the international Trust-Hub library are selected as the detection object and implanted to the encryption chip.       
Finally, the DBN model is utilized to extract the feature and reduce the dimensionality of the captured behavior data.       
The QPSO-OCSVM is used for detecting the anomalous behavior and obtaining the final detection result.
